Description: Global hypothesis tests combine information across multiple endpoints to
test a single hypothesis. The prediction test is a recently proposed global 
hypothesis test with good performance for small sample sizes and many endpoints of 
interest. The test is also flexible in the types and combinations of expected results 
across the individual endpoints. The ‘PredTest’ package provides functions for data 
processing and calculation of the prediction test.
